   

   run it first...and check is everything is okkk....
   It is working fine..


   so only i need to add some app.js functions... and corresponding chaincode..

   add public folder and index.html
   No.. We can not use 1.4 version..as we can not setup multi-host
   using this..


  so i will fix the public key finding issue ..And we have got a solution
  for this problem..

   Now again i need version 1.4 . So i want to uncomment it..
  Use new app.js and views and new chaincode..

   _/ 1. add views folder
   _/ 2. app.post('\login') and app.post('\register')
    x 3. add newly written chaincode 

   after adding chaincode i need to test 
    x 1. node invoke.js 
    x 2. node query.js
    X 3. and finally node app.js okk??
