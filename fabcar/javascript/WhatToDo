   It is working fine..


   add public folder and index.html
   _/ we have found a way for public key issue
   _/ 1. add views folder

    app.js
   _/ 2. app.post('\login') and app.post('\register')
    x 3. update app.post('\') and app.get('\') 

    chaincode
   _/ 3. add getUserInfo & storeUserInfo function
    x 4. add pi stucture
    x 5. add initLedger, latestData & sensorData function
    x 6. add action in Invoke function

   after adding chaincode i need to test 
    _/ 1. node invoke.js 
    _/ 2. node query.js
     x 3. and finally node app.js okk??

     x 4. error : fail to open wallet file
     X 5. fail to login buffer error 

   x  solution 1: I handle promise just like fabric 1.2 version.. Still inspite of creating file it shows no such file or directory..So what to do then???? 
   x solution 2: use promise-fs .. I think it will not work as we have no need to await reading file..
   x  solution 3: outside of register function.. But then no such file or directory ...
   solution 4: give some secs for load time sleep 
    Nothing is work out I do not know what should i do...
